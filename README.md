# DS-project-with-Python
In this repository, you can find Data Science projects with Python related to data cleansing, DataViz, ML, text mining, clustering, and social networks. <br/>

The projects in this repository were part of the Specialization in Data Science taught by the Michigan University through the Coursera Platform.<br/>
Here I show the solutions I implemented for every of the proposed exercises/projects along the 5 courses of the specialization.
